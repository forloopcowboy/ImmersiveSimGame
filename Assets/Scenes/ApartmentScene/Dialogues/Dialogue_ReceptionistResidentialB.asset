    - Hey there, resident.
    - I hear you are new to this town. Welcome to Serraland.
    - Oh, it's your first day working on the Grand Crystalizer?
    - I'm sure you've been informed already, but on their first day, employees are
      allowed to explore the town! You know, get your bearings, socialize. I hear
      there's some studies that say it improves Employee morale.
    - "Your colleagues at the Grand Crystalizer normally congregate at the Colinas
      caf\xE9 or the Tabacarium."
    - Be sure to register for the Nightly Callout at 7pm. You must be early to bed
      to enjoy a productive day at the factory tomorrow!
