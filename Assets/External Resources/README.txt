EXTERNAL RESOURCES FOLDER
##########################

This folder is reserved for importing heavy resources such as images, videos, etc. that can be used for the project
but will not be included in source control. When using an external resource that you intend on versioning, move it out
of this folder and into the appropriate folder in the project Assets root.
